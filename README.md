This is my imagining of what I'd have the Street Taco restaurant website look like.

I started this on September 16, and I completed it on October 1. At this time, the look of the site is complete. All of the sections reflect my vision, on desktop systems and mobile devices.

For this, HTML and CSS were used, as well as JavaScript, jQuery, and the Bootstrap 4 Beta library.

This is just one of the few projects I have planned to reflect my knowledge of front end web development.
